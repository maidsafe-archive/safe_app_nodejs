## External Libraries

The external libraries will automatically be downloaded when you run `npm install`.

If you are working on a development environment, you can run `NODE_ENV=dev npm install` instead in order to get the `safe_client` libraries which use the `MockVault` file rather than connecting to the SAFE Network.
