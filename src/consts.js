/**
* @typedef {Object} CONSTANTS
* Constants available for the applications to be used in a few cases
* as values of input parameters.
*
* @param {Number} NFS_FILE_MODE_OVERWRITE NFS File open in overwrite mode.
* When used as the `openMode` parameter for `nfs.open(<fileName>, <openMode>)` the entire content
* of the file will be replaced when writing data to it.
*
* @param {Number} NFS_FILE_MODE_APPEND NFS File open in append mode.
* When used as the `openMode` param for `nfs.open(<fileName>, <openMode>)` any new content
* written to the file will be appended to the end without modifying existing data.
*
* @param {Number} NFS_FILE_MODE_READ NFS File open in read-only mode.
* When used as the `openMode` param for `nfs.open(<fileName>, <openMode>)` only the read
* operation is allowed.
*
* @param {Number} NFS_FILE_START Read the file from the beginning.
* When used as the `position` param for the NFS `file.read(<position>, <length>)`
* function, the file will be read from the beginning.
*
* @param {Number} NFS_FILE_END Read until the end of a file.
* When used as the `length` param for the NFS `file.read(<position>, <length>)`
* function, the file will be read from the position provided until the end
* of its content. E.g. if `NFS_FILE_START` and `NFS_FILE_END` are passed in as
* the `position` and `length` parameters respectively, then the whole content of the
* file will be read.
*
* @param {Number} USER_ANYONE Any user.
* When used as the `signkey` param in any of the MutableData functions to
* manipulate user permissions, like `getUserPermissions`, `setUserPermissions`,
* `delUserPermissions`, etc., this will associate the permissions operation to
* any user rather than to a particular sign key.
* E.g. if this constant is used as the `signkey` param of
* the `setUserPermissions(<signKey>, <permissionSet>, <version>)` function,
* the permissions in the `permissionSet` provided will be granted to anyone
* rather to a specific user's/aplication's sign key.
*
* @param {String} MD_METADATA_KEY MutableData's entry key where its metadata is stored.
* The MutableData's metadata can be set either when invoking the `quickSetup`
* function or by invking the `setMetadata` function.
* The metadata is stored as an encoded entry in the MutableData which key
* is `MD_METADATA_KEY`, thus this constant can be used to realise which of the
* entries is not application's data but the MutableData's metadata instead.
* The metadata is particularly used by the Authenticator when another
* application has requested mutation permissions on a MutableData,
* displaying this information to the user, so the user can make a better
* decision to either allow or deny such a request based on it.
*
* @param {Number} MD_ENTRIES_EMPTY Represents an empty set of MutableData's entries.
* This can be used when invoking the `put` function of the MutableData API to
* signal that it should be committed to the network with an empty set of entries.
*
* @param {Number} MD_PERMISSION_EMPTY Represents an empty set of MutableData's permissions.
* This can be used when invoking the `put` function of the MutableData API to
* signal that it should be committed to the network with an empty set of permissions.
