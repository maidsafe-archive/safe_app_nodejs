# safe_app nodejs Change Log

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Add instructions to the README for how to generate API docs locally
- Support for exposing experimental APIs when `--enable-experimental-apis` argument is passed, or when `enableExperimentalApis` flag is set in the initialisation option
- Experimental function `fetch` which can fetch a network resource from a URL, returning the target network object (`content`), the type of the resource fetched (`resourceType`), and the parsed path from the provided URL (`parsedPath`)
- Experimental RDF emulation layer which provides an abstraction to generate and manipulate RDF data on the SAFE network
- Experimental WebID emulation layer which provides an abstraction to generate and manipulate WebID profile documents on the SAFE network.
- Experimental Web API which provides utilities to manage public names and subNames, get the list of owned WebIDs, get list of owned public names, etc.
- Rename `isMockBuild` function to `appIsMock` to match the renaming in safe_app lib v0.9.0.

### Changed
- Dependency downloader configuration to download both mock and prod libs without `NODE_ENV=dev`
- Upgrades deps_downloader to v0.3.0
- Code refactoring in the browsing tests cases
- Upgrade safe_app native library to v0.9.0
- Refactors instances of deprecated `new Buffer` to `Buffer.from` to comply with Node v10

### Fixed
- Change docs to reflect testing condition for `loginForTest` and `simulateNetworkDisconnect` functions.
- NFS write argument to match documentation annotation
- RDF emulation now encrypts also the entries' values (issue #281)
- RDF emulation now can decrypt data fetched from a private MutableData (issue #283)
- Resolved issue #282, populate `_publicNames` correctly when creating multiple WebIDs

### Added
- New binding `simulateNetworkDisconnect()` function to simulate a network disconnection event useful for applications testing purposes.
